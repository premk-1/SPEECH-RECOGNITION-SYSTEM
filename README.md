ðŸ“Œ Project: Text Summarization Tool using AI
âœ… Overview:
Text summarization is the process of shortening a text document while preserving its essential information. There are two main types:

Extractive Summarization: Selects key sentences from the original text.

Abstractive Summarization: Generates new sentences that capture the meaning of the text, similar to how humans summarize.

âœ… Project Workflow:
1. Input:
User provides a long document or text.

2. Processing:
Preprocessing: Clean the text (lowercasing, removing stopwords, punctuation, etc.)

Summarization:

Extractive: Using techniques like TF-IDF, TextRank.

Abstractive: Using a pre-trained transformer model (like T5, BART, or GPT-based models).

3. Output:
Shortened, coherent summary.

âœ… Tools and Libraries:
Python

nltk / spacy (for preprocessing)

sklearn (for extractive methods)

transformers (for abstractive summarization)

Pretrained models: t5-small, facebook/bart-large-cnn

âœ… Basic Python Example:
ðŸ“‚ Setup:
bash
pip install transformers nltk
